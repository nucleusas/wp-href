# WP Hreflang Multisite

Manage hreflang tags across WordPress multisite networks. Uses the main site as a source of truth for multilingual content relationships.

## Quick Start

1. Network activate the plugin
2. Configure locale overrides in Network Admin → Settings → Hreflang if needed
3. Link related content using the sidebar panel in the post editor

The plugin requires all sites to have a unique locale to work correctly. Use the settings page to override the hreflang locale for sites where the WordPress locale is not specific enough. This setting does not affect the WordPress locale used for the site.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.6+
